# Project M

This is a long-term project that a small team and I will gradually work on throughout the year. My goals for this project involve keeping my programming and Unity skills sharp; writing code with a focus on expandability, performance, and readability; and eventually even submitting Project M to Steam and other game distribution platforms!
