# Project M

This is a long-term project that a small team and I will gradually work on throughout the year.  
  
  My goals for this project involve:  
-Keeping my programming and Unity skills sharp  
-Writing code with a focus on expandability, performance, and readability  
-Eventually, submitting Project M to Steam and other game distribution platforms!
